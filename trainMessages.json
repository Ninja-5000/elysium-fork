    "HISTORY OF SEX FIRST AGE - ANCIENT EGYPT\nBad for humans but sacred for the gods...\nPapyrus 55001, also known as \"Turin\", or \"Erotic Papyrus\", is known as the first written source of sex culture from Ancient Egypt, discovered in the 19th century. In a way, this first known pornographic journal was hidden from people for centuries. In fact, Etymologist Charlotte Booth said, \"After it was found, it was locked away in libraries. You had to get permission to look at it, and you had to have a good reason for it,\" says etymologist Charlotte Booth. \"And only men were allowed to study this document.\" It's not that big of a deal, don't get any Playboy magazine shoots in your head. The papyrus contains pornographic images, or rather illustrations, of 12 male and female figures. \"People think of Ancient Egypt as a repressive and conservative society,\" says historian and author Bettany Hughes. They are absolutely wrong about that,\" says Bettany Hughes, historian and author. \"In ancient Egypt, being a sexually active nobleman was a social marker that was highly valued in society.\" \"When you look at the papyri, you can find all the fantasies and desires that we have today,\" says Dr. Richard Parkinson, Curator of the British Museum, the world's most comprehensive museum. \"The only difference is that the Egyptians combined sex with fantastic, exotic elements like mummies, pyramids and gods. In ancient Egypt, sex was seen as a closed activity for the lower classes of society. But when it comes to describing the sexual habits of their gods, the inscriptions become completely pornographic. They put things into their sacred scriptures that even today we cannot describe in our books.\" This is why anthropologists and historians decided to study the sexual habits of the images of the gods and pharaohs in hieroglyphs to understand the sex habits of Ancient Egypt. \"In ancient Egypt, nature was embraced as a fertile and productive image,\" says etymologist Charlotte Booth. \"Therefore, the beginning of nature is depicted by the sex and fertility of the chief gods, Isis and Osiris.\"\nAmon Min: There is another image of Min in the same museum, carved on the wall with a nail. But in this wall painting, of course, the genitalia could not be removed. Instead, a sign was placed directly on that part of the painting saying, \"This section is censored due to sexual content\". This sign was removed after the end of the Victorian era.\nAccording to researchers, sex objects and other written documents about sex found in Ancient Egypt have incurred the wrath of historians and politicians. The most prominent example of this is an ancient Egyptian god Amon Min in the British Museum. Min is called the god of fertility in Ancient Egypt. If you search for fertility gods on the internet, you will realize that in many cultures fertility is described with male or female genitalia. No joke... However, the statue, which is preserved in its entirety in the museum, is missing only one part. The genitalia... Bettany Hughes says that the statue was made like this by conservatives during the Victorian Era in England in the 19th century.\nCleopatra is considered to be the last Egyptian pharaoh who prevented the invasion of her country for many years by making two Roman emperors fall in love with her. In ancient Egypt, sex symbolized desire and passion.\nPublished in Cosmopolitan Magazine",

    "how can i not procrastinate?",
    "Procrastination can be a challenging habit to overcome, but there are strategies you can try to help increase your productivity. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Break tasks into smaller steps: Sometimes, the enormity of a task can be overwhelming and lead to procrastination. Breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps can make it less intimidating and easier to get started.\n\n2. Set clear goals and deadlines: Having specific goals and deadlines can provide structure and motivation. Set realistic and achievable goals, and establish deadlines to keep yourself accountable.\n\n3. Create a schedule or to-do list: Planning your day or week ahead can help you stay organized and prioritize tasks. Make a to-do list, assign time slots for each task, and stick to the schedule as much as possible.\n\n4. Use time-management techniques: Techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for a set period of time and then take short breaks, can help improve focus and prevent burnout.\n\n5. Minimize distractions: Identify and minimize distractions that can derail your focus and productivity. This can include turning off notifications on your phone or computer, finding a quiet workspace, or using apps/extensions that block specific websites or apps during designated work periods.\n\n6. Find motivation and rewards: Find ways to motivate yourself and reward your progress. This can be through setting rewards for completing tasks or focusing on the long-term benefits and satisfaction of accomplishing your goals.\n\n7. Practice self-care: Taking care of your physical and mental well-being is crucial for maintaining focus and productivity. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat well, exercise regularly, and take breaks when needed.\n\nRemember, breaking the habit of procrastination takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and try different strategies to find what works best for you. Good luck! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance.",
